# Information Systems Introduction

I am glad to see you took one of your first steps in becoming an information technology expert. My name is Mark, and I am one of the few who work here at Obfuscated Technologies.

I will be one of the most social media hosts and curators of our content. I am excited to learn more about all of you and would encourage you to comment a little about yourself at the end of this article for others to read.

# What sets us apart? 

Obfuscated Technologies and its sister company, Obfuscated Learning, were started to fill the gap of frustration that many feel while trying to get into ITâ€”the hands-on portion! CompTIA, ISC2, and numerous others are great at teaching basic facts and terms but lack teaching the day-to-day skills. Their multiple-choice, archaic tests are incapable of doing so.

Here at Obfuscated Technologies, our cyber fundamentals course will require a decent amount of basic facts and terms to ensure anyone interested in getting into IT is not left behind. Follow-on courses will involve fewer and fewer facts and terms and more hands-on learning.

# Our mission

Our goal is for all our students to be ready to walk into their respective jobs (based on the course you took) and be able to perform the day-to-day tasks on day one. We also guarantee that our students will be able to walk into a tech interview and answer many common questions that they may be unable to answer otherwise from other brands' training.

Our students have felt your frustration. We understand that many feel, after taking those other certifications, that they are no more ready to step into a job than before. Our hands-on learning and practice interviews will leave you with the confidence you need to impress the recruiters and hiring managers.
