# What is a computer?
A computer is a programmable electronic device that processes data and performs tasks according to a set of instructions called a program. It can store, retrieve, and process data, allowing it to perform various functions. Computers come in different forms, including personal computers, servers, mainframes, and embedded systems in everyday devices.

Key components of a computer include:

1. Central Processing Unit (CPU): Often referred to as the brain of the computer, the CPU executes instructions from a computer program by performing basic arithmetic, logic, control, and input/output operations.

2. Memory (RAM): Random Access Memory (RAM) is temporary storage that the computer uses to store data that is actively being used or processed. It allows for quick access to information.

3. Storage: This refers to the long-term storage of data on devices like hard drives, solid-state drives, or other storage media. It retains data even when the computer is powered off.

4. Input Devices: These are devices that allow users to input data into the computer, such as keyboards and mice.

5. Output Devices: Devices like monitors and printers display or provide results of the computer's processing.

6. Motherboard: The main circuit board that connects and facilitates communication between various hardware components.

7. Software: Programs and applications that provide instructions for the computer to execute specific tasks.

Computers can run a wide range of software applications, from simple word processors and web browsers to complex operating systems and software used for scientific research, design, and programming. They play a crucial role in various aspects of modern life, including communication, education, entertainment, and business.

# Hardware vs Software
[Back to overview](#overview)

Hardware and software are two fundamental components of a computer system, and they work together to enable the computer to perform tasks and process information. Here's a brief overview of the differences between hardware and software:

## Hardware:
1. Definition: Hardware refers to the physical components of a computer systemâ€”the tangible, touchable parts.

2. Examples: Central Processing Unit (CPU), memory (RAM), storage devices (hard drives, SSDs), motherboard, graphics card, input devices (keyboard, mouse), output devices (monitor, printer), and more.

3. Function: Hardware components work together to execute instructions and perform tasks. The CPU processes data, memory stores information for quick access, storage devices store data for the long term, and input/output devices facilitate communication with the user.

4. Modifiability: Hardware is typically more challenging to modify or upgrade compared to software. Upgrading hardware often involves physically replacing components.

## Software:
1. Definition: Software refers to the programs, applications, and data that instruct the computer on how to perform specific tasks. It is a set of instructions that tell the hardware what to do.

2. Examples: Operating systems (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux), word processors, web browsers, video games, antivirus programs, and more.

3. Function: Software provides the logic and functionality that enables the hardware to perform tasks. It includes both the operating system that manages hardware resources and user applications that execute specific functions.

4. Modifiability: Software is more flexible and easier to modify compared to hardware. Updates, patches, and new applications can be installed or removed without physically altering the computer's components.

## Relationship:
1. Interdependence: Hardware and software are interdependent. Hardware provides the platform for software to run, and software gives instructions for the hardware to execute tasks.

2. Upgrade Cycles: Hardware upgrades might be necessary for running more demanding software, and software updates often optimize compatibility with new hardware.

In summary, hardware is the physical infrastructure of a computer system, while software is the set of instructions that govern the computer's behavior. Both are crucial for the proper functioning of a computer, and they work together to enable various applications and tasks.

# Operating System (OS)
[Back to overview](#overview)

An operating system (OS) is a software program that serves as the core and primary interface between computer hardware and the various applications that run on it. It manages the computer's hardware resources, provides a user interface, and facilitates the execution of programs. The operating system plays a critical role in enabling users to interact with the computer system and ensuring the efficient utilization of hardware resources.

## Key functions of an operating system include:

1. Process Management: The OS oversees the execution of processes (programs in execution), managing their creation, scheduling, termination, and communication with one another.

2. Memory Management: The OS allocates and deallocates memory space for different processes to ensure efficient use of the computer's RAM (Random Access Memory).

3. File System Management: It organizes and controls the storage of data on various storage devices, such as hard drives or SSDs. This includes file creation, deletion, and manipulation.

4. Device Management: The OS interacts with and manages input and output devices like keyboards, mice, printers, and others. It provides a standardized interface for applications to communicate with hardware.

5. Security and Access Control: The OS is responsible for protecting the system and user data, implementing user authentication, and controlling access to resources to ensure a secure computing environment.

6. User Interface: The operating system provides a user interface, which can be command-line-based or graphical, allowing users to interact with the computer system and run applications.

7. Network Management: In networked environments, the OS facilitates communication between computers, managing network connections and data transfer.

Popular operating systems include Microsoft Windows, macOS (used in Apple computers), Linux (and its various distributions), and Unix. Each operating system has its own set of features, user interface design, and strengths, making it suitable for different types of users and applications.

In summary, an operating system is a crucial software layer that enables the interaction between a computer's hardware and software, providing essential services to ensure the efficient and secure operation of the entire computer system.
